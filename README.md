# TT-v3.8.3
Torrent Trader 3.8.3 version compatible with PHP8+

Torrenttrader is the script that is built on M-Jay source code and MicroMonkey updates.
The structure of the fundamental code itself has not changed much, but the adaptation between different PHP versions has required that it be adapted to the ordinary PHP version.
The latest upload is largely adapted to PHP 8.3.25
All you need to do is download the structure and install it on your server...
PS
don't forget that you need recaptcha keys from CloudFlare
